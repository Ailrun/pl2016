(** **** Problem #2: 1 star (factorial) *)
(** Recall the standard factorial function:
<<
    factorial(0)  =  1 
    factorial(n)  =  n * factorial(n-1)     (if n>0)
>>
    Translate this into Coq. 

    Note that plus and multiplication are already defined in Coq.
    use "+" for plus and "*" for multiplication.
